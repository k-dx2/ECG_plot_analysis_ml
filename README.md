A simple GUI based on python to analyse the relation between RR interval and Time using Linear Regression over single and multiple intervals for ECG plots.

1.What is an ACQ file- An ACQ file is a data graph file created by AcqKnowledge, a program used to simulate physiological data recorded from different systems and transducers. It contains physiological data recorded from an organism that is displayed in waveforms in AcqKnowledge. ACQ files also store information about how the data was collected, including the rate and duration of the collection. AcqKnowledge is commonly used with BIOPAC hardware, which specializes in collecting data such as EMG, pulse, respiration, EEG, electrogastrogram, temperature, and eye movement of a person.

Setup.

1.Install bioread libraries by

pip install bioread

2.Install Tkinter module for the GUI.
